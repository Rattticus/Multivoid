// ue_wrap/desk/desk_ping.h -- the main desk's ping machine (analogDScreenTest_C) and its verdict: the run flag, the
// stage and the three accumulators process_coords advances, and spaceRenderer_C::gatherSignal, which the machine calls
// in the same process_coords call that takes it to stage 3 (analogDScreenTest.cpp:1440-1491, spaceRenderer.cpp:542).
// The cheat menu's isntaCatchSignal calls the same verdict outside the machine (:7226). Engine-wrapper layer
// (principle 7), no network or coop state. Game thread, every function. Implementation: src/ue_wrap/desk/desk_ping.cpp.
