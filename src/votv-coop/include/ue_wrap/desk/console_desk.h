// ue_wrap/desk/console_desk.h -- engine access for the four-screen main desk
// (analogDScreenTest_C): the live-visible scalar set the DeskState lane mirrors, the
// screen-refresh chain and the coords-screen log append. Engine-wrapper layer, no network
// logic; console_state_sync drives the mirror through here. The desk is a singleton (the
// gamemode's analogPanels, one placed actor). Its persisted state rides the save transfer at
// join; the live divergence is the scalar set below (download, refine, playback and coords
// activity). The desk blueprint ticks on every peer. On a client its detection needle takes no
// step of its own (desk_sim_sync parks the step's input), so the needle is the host's, and the
// other mirror writes are convergence nudges on the discrete states, not a fight with the local
// sim. Every field offset resolves through reflection.
