// ue_wrap/desk/desk_press.h -- a player's press on the main desk (analogDScreenTest_C), as the game makes it: the
// player's useSelectedAction runs the desk's lookAt(player, hit), which sets the panel under the player's eye, and
// then actionOptionIndex(player, hit, action, lookAtComponent), whose body takes the pressed button from the hit
// (analogDScreenTest.cpp:2355). A press made here replays that pair with a hit on the chosen component; a press the
// game makes is read back from its actionOptionIndex frame. Engine-wrapper layer (principle 7), no network or coop
// state. Game thread, every function. Implementation: src/ue_wrap/desk/desk_press.cpp.
