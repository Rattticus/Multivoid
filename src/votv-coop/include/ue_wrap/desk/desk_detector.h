// ue_wrap/desk/desk_detector.h -- the main desk's detection needle (analogDScreenTest_C): the multiplier its step
// reads, the canDL latch canSaveSignal keeps, the game's own painters of both, and the ubergraph's path after the
// step. The needle loop resumes ExecuteUbergraph_analogDScreenTest at kLoopEntry; after the step, at kPostStepEntry,
// come the texts, the crossing check, the crossing block and setFullyProcessedSignalObject (the desk's CFG). Entering
// there runs that code as the step's own fall-through runs it. Engine-wrapper layer (principle 7), no network or coop
// state. Game thread, every function. Implementation: src/ue_wrap/desk/desk_detector.cpp.
