// ue_wrap/desk/comp_pane.h -- the main desk's refiner (comp) pane surface: the
// decode scalars + the comp_data_0 struct base + the pane repaint / direct
// paints / cue actions -- one desk sub-surface per file, so the desk actor
// and the atlas widget chain stay owned
// by ue_wrap::console_desk (Instance() / AtlasWidget() publics). Principle-7
// engine-wrapper layer -- NO network logic; coop::comp_sync drives the
// mirror through here.
//
// The decode ticker is gated on isDreaming, active_comp and comp_isDecodeActive,
// and on nothing else -- no occupancy condition -- so any awake
// machine with the flag latched SIMULATES (and completion fires world
// triggers incl. the level-3 theEvil_C spawn). Mirrors therefore stay
// passive: raw scalar writes + direct paints + cue edges; the flag is never
// written true from the wire.
