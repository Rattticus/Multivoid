// ue_wrap/desk/coord_tower.h -- the three coordinate towers (coordRadarDish_C): their state, its raw writes, and
// the tower's own painters and verbs.
//
// The towers triangulate the coordinates panel's cursor. Each can break: eight fuses and a lights-out puzzle,
// both saved with the actor, and a broken tower blocks the ping and the movement keys. A tower that loads broken
// scrambles itself again inside its own loadData, on every machine that loads the save. Its panel opens on a
// montage whose end flips `opened`; its lever runs a timeline whose end judges the puzzle. A player's use reads
// the look-at getActionOptions wrote from that player's trace. Instances come from the object index, never from
// a walk. Principle 7: no network or gameplay logic. Game thread.
