// ue_wrap/core/ufunction_hook.h -- patch a native UFunction's Func pointer to catch a call our
// ProcessEvent detour can NEVER see.
//
// Engine-wrapper layer (principle 7): no gameplay or network logic. Our only MinHook seam is
// UObject::ProcessEvent, the OUTER entry to the Blueprint VM. A BP-internal call -- EX_CallMath,
// EX_FinalFunction, EX_VirtualFunction, EX_Local*Function -- routes through UFunction::Invoke to
// (Context->*Func)(Stack, Result), one layer BELOW the detour, and never re-enters ProcessEvent, so
// a ProcessEvent observer on such a callee registers and never fires. The chipPile grab and the
// clump re-pile spawn are exactly this.
//
// SCOPE, AND IT IS LOAD-BEARING: those routes funnel through `Func` only when the callee is NATIVE.
// Both dispatch handlers branch on FUNC_Native, and a SCRIPT (bytecode) callee goes through
// ProcessScriptFunction to ProcessInternal, never reading Func at all. Per-function detail:
// docs/coop-dispatch-visibility.md.

// Post-native observer. `context` is the dispatch Context -- for a member call the object the
// function runs ON, such as the DYING actor for K2_DestroyActor; for a static GameplayStatics call
// the world-context-ish caller. `sourceObject` is FFrame::Object, the actor whose BYTECODE is
// executing, so the caller: the re-piling clump that issued a spawn. `spawnedResult` is *Result,
// the native function's RESULT_PARAM -- for BeginDeferred the new actor, and possibly null on a
// failed spawn. Fires AFTER the original Func returns, so `spawnedResult` is populated. Raw
// UObject*s.
//
// THREADING: native UFunction dispatch, UWorld::SpawnActor among it, is GAME-THREAD only, so this
// runs on the game thread -- but DEEP inside an engine call, so it MUST be cheap and MUST NOT
// throw. The facility SEH-wraps it as a crash backstop, the same firewall contract the ProcessEvent
// observers have.

// that is the calling Blueprint function (`function`) and its storage (`locals`), where each of its
// locals and parameters sits at its Offset_Internal (reflection::FindPropertyOffset on the
// function); for a call through ProcessEvent it is the called function and its parameters, so check
// `function` before reading. An ubergraph's locals are the actor's persistent frame, which is how a
// spawn issued inside a Blueprint loop names the loop's current element. Both null outside any
// callback; code a callback runs sees that callback's frame. Game thread.

// Blueprint makes of an object the answer that object stands in for. Null outside any callback
// and for a function with no return value. Game thread.

// (which steps the params off the bytecode stream, runs the implementation and writes *Result),

// Idempotent per (ufunction, cb). Returns false if the arguments are null, the table is full, or
// the Func slot reads null -- a wrong offset for this build, where refusing beats corrupting the
// UFunction. There is no unpatch: a Func patch replaces an observation scheme wholesale once
// proven. `armed` false installs the patch disarmed (SetArmed). Game thread.
//
// The scope rule above is about the DISPATCH ROUTE, not the callee list. Script overrides ARE
// patched here and DO fire -- puppet_spawn's BlueprintUpdateAnimation, save_indicator_suppress's
// saveAnim and addHint -- because their dispatch is ProcessEvent, whose Invoke also reads Func.
// What does not work is a script function called via EX_Local*: the patch INSTALLS, since Func is
// ProcessInternal and non-null and passes the guard, it LOGS "patched", and it NEVER FIRES. That

// calling frame while it runs. Cancel refuses the call: the original never runs, and the call's

// through the VM's exec-handler table, so a post forwarder never sees them, and UE4SS's native pre-hook reads
// the frame's Locals (LuaMod.cpp:128-200), which hold them only on the ProcessEvent path. This one steps them
// through the same table (script_gate::ExecHandlers) into a frame of its own. Run rewinds the caller's code
// pointer and forwards, so the original steps them again: the engine's own shape for a native it calls both
// remotely and locally (UObject::CallFunction). A ProcessEvent call's parameters are read from its frame.
// Refused at install, logged: a script function, a return value, an out or reference parameter, a parameter
// the engine must destroy, a frame past this one's, no exec-handler table. Off the game thread it forwards
// untouched. A pre hook stays the outermost patch on its function in either install order, so a post hook
// never reports a call its pre hook refused. `armed` defaults to false, the shape being a seam armed only
// while a call of the consumer's own runs. Idempotent per (ufunction, cb). Game thread.
