// ue_wrap/world/game_mode.h -- the game's mode enum, and the mode the running world is under.
//
// VOTV names its campaign flavours in one blueprint enum, enum_gamemode: eight members, story
// through solar, whose ordinals are not the order the mode menu shows them in (sandbox is 4, not
// 1). The cook strips the enumerators' display names, so the ordinal-to-name map below comes from
// the enum asset's own name table, cross-read against the save-name prefixes the game's slot menu
// derives per mode. The mode a world runs under is one byte on the GameInstance, outside the rules
// struct: read by the rules snapshot and the save browser, written by the two boots in
// ue_wrap/engine/engine_save.cpp, and relayed to a joining peer in the save-transfer header. One
// owner for all of it, so the bound, the names and the byte's address are each stated once.
// Principle 7: the engine read and write only -- ui/ owns the render. Game thread.
