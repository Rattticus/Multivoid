// whether it simulates, its linear and angular velocity, and its centre of mass. Engine-wrapper layer (principle 7):
// each call is one reflected UFunction call on the component, with a stack parameter frame and no
// allocation, so the held-prop drive can make one every tick. Each UFunction resolves once; one
// that does not resolve is said once and its call is a no-op from then on. Game thread.
