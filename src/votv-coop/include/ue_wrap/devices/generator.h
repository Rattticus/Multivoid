// ue_wrap/devices/generator.h -- engine access for the base's three transformers (Agenerator_C), in the order of
// gamemode.generators. Principle-7 engine-wrapper layer: no network or coop state; coop/world/power_grid drives
// the grid lane through here. A generator's state is its row: broken, its wear `cycle` (100 new, 0 broken), its
// `upgradeLevel` (0..6) and the saved `cyc`. break() latches, plays the 2D turn-off, zeroes the wear, runs
// update() (the turn-off at the generator, then upd(), which blacks the base out through the panel) and scrambles
// the repair puzzle. damage() is one step of wear: the cycle down by one and the puzzle's sine page scrambled, or
// break() at the last step. A player's repair is the Activate button with the puzzle solved: it mends a broken
// generator in place (isBroken off, the wear full, turnedOn, update(), then its completion trigger) and services
// a whole one (the wear full, the 2D turn-on). fullFix() solves the puzzle and does the mend's writes, turnedOn and
// upd(), but plays nothing and runs no trigger. Verbs resolve on the generator in hand, since a Blueprint class
// can be a new object in a new world.
