// ue_wrap/devices/power_control.h -- engine access for the base's power panel (ApowerControl_C). Principle-7
// engine-wrapper layer: no network or coop state; coop/world/power_panel drives the lane through here.
//
// The panel holds five latched breakers, read and written here as one mask in field order: bit0 press_coord,
// bit1 press_downl, bit2 press_play, bit3 press_calc, bit4 press_light. The base has one, gamemode.powerControl.
// ButtonsVisibility is the panel's own full apply, the verb every press ends in: the panel's repaint, its
// fan-out to the servers, the light groups, the base sockets and the wall cords (each run only when its breaker
// differs from the value the last fan-out cached), and gamemode.setPower while the panel is not disabled and the
// generators are fine. Verbs resolve on the panel in hand, since a Blueprint class can be a new object in a new
// world.
