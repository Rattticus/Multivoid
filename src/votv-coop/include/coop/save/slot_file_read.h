// coop/save/slot_file_read.h -- a save slot's file, read whole only once it holds still. VOTV's saveToSlot
// writes the .sav in place, with no rename, so a join landing mid-write would read a torn blob: the file
// is trusted only when its size and time hold across two polls 300 ms apart and two consecutive full
// reads are CRC-identical (the torn-read guard). The CRC is the save stream's, both sides of the wire.
