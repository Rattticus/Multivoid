// coop/interactables/drive_payload_sync.h -- a data drive's recorded row (prop_drive_C.data_0): the host authors it, a
// client's copy holds the host's rows, and every drive a client brings into the world sends its row to the host.
// Its writers are all Blueprint and each is followed by the drive's own upd() on the peer that ran it (a box or rack
// take, a cheat, the thrower, loadData on every route a stored item comes back by, the eraser, the desk). So the host
// sends a drive's row at the POST of prop_drive_C::upd when it changed and at a drive's enrolment when it is not its
// class default's; a client puts back, at the same POST, a drive whose row left the one it holds. A drive a client
// brings into the world (a fresh birth, a drop intent by any route, a held item) is noted by the prop lanes and sends
// its row to the host at its enrolment or its bind. The host takes one row per such drive, from the client that
// brought it and while its own copy is still at the class default, and answers any other client row with its own
// (MTA answers a cancelled element-data change to its source: CGame.cpp:2779-2793). A joiner's world-ready seed
// carries every row that differs from its class default.
