// coop/interactables/download_arm_sync.h -- the download machine's arm and reset: the host's, replayed on each client.
// The desk forms a download when its dishes stop (formDownload, which rolls the download's polarity when handed -1),
// and the gamemode's deleteActiveSignal resets it (the desk's "Signal data deleted" reset, which rolls it again, then
// the renderer's signal actor and the signal camera's trigger). The host is the machine's one author: the script
// gate's POSTs send each verb's outcome on DishArm. A client runs the same verb once, the host's decoded and polarity
// written into its parameters at the PREs while the replay runs, and refuses both outside one in the world it
// announced. A joiner gets a reset ahead of the desk's seed when its world was captured before one, and an armed
// machine's row after the catch's seed. MTA shape: the server's element data, applied on the client through the same
// setter (reference/mtasa-blue/Client/mods/deathmatch/logic/rpc/CElementRPCs.cpp:84-99, SetElementData).
