// coop/interactables/serverbox_sync.h -- the signal servers' break state, the host's: its verbs run there alone.
//
// A box's state is its broken flag, its `damaged` flag and the repair minigame type its break rolled, and the farm's
// three totals on the gamemode. Three verbs write it -- breakServer (eight callers, each a world event or a load),
// break_type (the desk's virus event) and fix (the player's repair minigame, the Kerfur, p_kerfus). The script gate
// watches the three BY NAME: a client refuses every one through its whole connected session, and its player's own
// repair -- fix called by the gamemode's repair widget -- goes to the host as a repair intent, which the host runs on
// its box when broken and within reach and answers, refused, with the state row to the presser alone. The host polls
// the state at about 1 Hz and broadcasts a change, at once after a repair, and sends a joiner the row at its
// world-ready; a client raw-writes each box's flags and type, re-skins through the notify-free check() and mirrors the
// totals. Identity is the save-stable servers[] index. MTA shape: the server validates a client's request and answers
// a refusal with its own value (reference/mtasa-blue/Server/mods/deathmatch/logic/CGame.cpp:2779-2793).
