// coop/interactables/meadow_db_sync.h -- the MEADOW signal-DATABASE mirror (saveSlot.savedSignals_0, and
// the ui_laptop widget's arrays in each world). Overview: docs/signals.md. Game thread throughout.
//
// The store has a MOVE verb (sortSignal) and Blueprint moves deep-copy FStrings, so neither the deck
// list's positional prefix walk nor pointer RowKeys work here. The shadow is a content-hash MULTISET
// instead (coop/interactables/meadow_db_hash), taken of the database -- its save object, which a travel
// keeps -- the first time the lane needs it, and compared with the database at the exit of each body that
// writes it: ui_laptop_C's addSignal, removeSignal and sortSignal, and the rename window's handler,
// watched at the script-body gate.
//
// A row that came authors a MeadowAppend, one that went a MeadowDelete (a rename is both), and an order
// that differs from what every peer will hold after those lines a MeadowOrder. Applies run through
// reflected addSignal and removeSignal inside the lane's own scope and update the shadow
// game-thread-atomically, which is what suppresses the echo. coop/dev/meadow_selftest drives the lane.

// host-terminal (the host applies last-writer-wins and broadcasts ITS canonical);
// clients apply host-authored lines only. After applying a client's append or
// delete the host sends its canonical too, since the author placed its row where
// its own lines left it. Apply = byte-permute + reflected genSignalList. An order

// that a pending op born before the snapshot -- whose effect the save already
// carries -- is not sent twice. That closes the window between the snapshot and
// world-ready, where a reliable send skips a not-yet-ready slot. It also stamps
// the pending exclude-masks that keep the seed and the retry from ever delivering
// the same line. The pen's parked lines from other clients follow the delta, since
// the session relayed them only to the peers ready when they came; while the
// host's own database is away the seed is owed, and runs once it is back, before
// the pen drains, forwarding only the lines parked before this joiner was ready.
