// coop/interactables/mirror_slot_entry.h -- a device never takes a prop another player is carrying.
//
// A device takes a prop by its own overlap: a drive entering a receiver port, a drive box or the rack, a module
// entering a desk slot, a back panel entering the desk's frame, a lid or a reel entering a reel case or the tape
// wall, a sack entering the drone. On a peer where another player carries that prop, the prop is a mirror its
// carrier's pose stream moves, and the device there would take it natively, outside every lane: it seats a prop its
// carrier still holds, and a port's insert drops THIS peer's own grab. So the rule sits on the prop: a prop a remote
// player carries is taken by its carrier's world alone, and every other peer refuses the device's overlap entry for
// it at the script gate, as it does for a device a remote player carries; the carrier's take reaches them through the
// device's own lane or the relayed destroy. The floppy slot's entry is
// the same rule for a disc in transit (coop/interactables/floppy_slot_entry). Two such takes are not refused yet,
// since no lane carries what they change and a refusal would only hide that: the back panel the desk's frame
// destroys into its panel state, and the sack the drone puts on. Game thread.
