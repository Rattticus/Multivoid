// coop/interactables/signal_catch_sync.h -- the STOLAS signal-catch CONSUME REPLAY. Overview:
// docs/signals.md. Game thread throughout.
//
// A successful ping runs a native chain on the machine that rolled its verdict, which is
// the host alone (desk_ping_sync rolls a client's verdict there): coord_signalData takes
// the gathered row, the sky row is deleted, the download machine resets, the ping sound
// plays, and every gamemode dish slews to the target.
//
// This module relays the host's catch as ONE world event and replays its IDENTITY half --
// the signal data, the sky-row delete, the catch's own two writes to the download machine --
// on every client. The dish THEATER half is the host's: its native slews stream as poses
// (dish_sync), and a client never slews from the wire. The download arm and reset ride the
// host-authored DishArm lane (coop/interactables/download_arm_sync).

// 1 Hz: the catch detector, plus recent-catch TTL pruning. Cheap when
// idle (one struct read).
//
// The catch detector is UNGATED: it fires on a change-edge of the coord_signalData
// identity tuple (x, y, z, frequency, objectName) to a non-None state, with no
// claim check in front of it. That is sound because the field has three native
// writers -- ping-success, which assigns the row, the delete chain, which assigns
// None, and the desk's setData, a save's restore on every load of a save -- and the
// restore and our own wire appliers prime these baselines, so an unprimed change on
// the host IS its catch. A client's is no catch of its own, since its verdicts are the
// host's: it is logged and not relayed. The gate is also necessary: a claim-anchored
// gate loses by construction, because the ping's own completion releases the desk
// hold within the same second as the edge, and the baseline then rolls forward over
// the catch permanently.

// Wire ingest (both roles). HOST: takes kind=1 and rebroadcasts it to everyone but
// its sender; drops kind=0 and kind=2, which are host-authored only. CLIENT: replays
// the identity half only (transport-trusted -- clients only ever receive from the
// host; senderSlot is the stamped logical catcher).
//
// kind=0 is a catch and lands one activity-feed line per peer, phrased for the
// catcher or for a watcher from the stamped origin. A clear is not this lane's: the
// host's signal-deleted reset reaches every peer on coop/interactables/download_arm_sync.

// HOST: if coord_signalData holds a caught signal, send the joiner one kind=2 STATE-SEED
// for the signal IDENTITY; a reset since the joiner's capture goes ahead of the desk's
// whole seed, and the dish snapshot and the download's arm row after this
// (download_arm_sync). kind=2 applies like a catch but never announces to the activity feed;
// it also carries the catch of a verdict whose client left before the detector found it.

// the slot's own included, stamped as its. One mark at a time, dropped when the slot leaves.
