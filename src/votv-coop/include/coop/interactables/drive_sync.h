// coop/interactables/drive_sync.h -- the drive chain's slot lane: DriveSlotState, the per-slot FSM state
// lines. RackState lives in drive_rack_sync and a drive's row in drive_payload_sync; this module keeps
// the slot and rack verb watches and forwards rack marks to drive_rack_sync.
//
// The design's slotted latch is SATISFIED BY the existing frozen/static pose gate in
// remote_prop.cpp: a slotted drive is frozen by putDriveIn on every peer, so straggler poses are
// already dropped and a second mechanism would be redundant. Game thread throughout.
