// coop/interactables/laptop_buffer_sync.h -- the laptop file-buffer QUAD sync lane {floppyData, floppyBuffer,
// floppyBufferUIDs, floppyReadwrites}, between two changes of which disc the laptop holds.
//
// Shape: a client sends change-edge EDIT-SCRIPT batches in the grammar the native verbs actually use (removeAt, and
// append at the END -- nothing moves in place); the host applies them content-anchored and answers with an
// UNCONDITIONAL canonical, which IS the acknowledgement; its own edits go straight to a canonical. Receivers adopt
// canonicals from slot 0 only, draining pending edits first, skipping the rebuild when the content already matches,
// and rebuilding the widget EAGERLY -- updFloppy regenerates floppyBuffer FROM bufferSlots.
//
// Wire: ReliableKind::LaptopQuad over BlobChunkPayload, head byte 0 a client's batch, 1 the host's canonical. Both
// carry the laptop's generation from coop/interactables/floppy_slot_sync, which owns which disc the slot holds, and
// ride its lane: the host refuses a batch of another generation, a client drops a canonical of another, and neither
// end sends while that lane has not settled the disc. Never refanned. Game thread throughout.
