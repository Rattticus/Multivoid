// coop/interactables/dish_calib_sync.h -- the dishes' precision (dish.calibration): the host authors it, a client's
// copy holds the host's values, and a client player's own verbs reach the host as intents.
// Its writers are nine Blueprint bodies (ue_wrap/desk/dish.h names them): some run on every peer (a mirrored
// lightning strike's hit, a slewing dish's own loss), some on the machine that starts them (the virus event, the
// cheat menu), two at a player's own verb. So the host's poll sends its changed dishes once a second, as floats (the
// toolgun's tool writes any value), and all of them when its baseline primes; a joiner gets all of them at its world-
// ready. A client sends no batch and the host refuses one. A client's copy holds the host's values for the session
// and puts back whatever moved it off one: at its poll, before mainGamemode.setPrec averages the dishes into its
// download's rate, and at a verb's entry in its announced world outside another verb, which then reads them. MTA
// puts a remote ped's synced health back every pulse (CClientPed::LockHealth, reapplied in StreamedInPulse). The two
// verbs a client player performs (ue_wrap/desk/dish_writers) run on its copy and at their exit send the dishes they
// changed to the host as an intent; the host performs what it can and answers with every live dish named, to all once
// something was performed and to the author alone otherwise, as coop/interactables/server_upgrade_sync answers ops.
