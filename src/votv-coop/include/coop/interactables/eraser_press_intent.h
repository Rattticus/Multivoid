// coop/interactables/eraser_press_intent.h -- the drive eraser's delete button, as a client's intent the host presses.
// Overview: docs/signals.md. Gameplay/network layer (principle 7); the engine is reached through ue_wrap.
//
// The eraser (signalDriveEraser_C) is level-placed, one per world, with no key and no element id. Its delete button,
// action 4, starts a 3 s Delay while its slot holds a drive, and the resume wipes the drive in THAT peer's slot, so a
// client's press wiped only its own copy. A drive's row is the host's (drive_payload_sync), so this lane refuses the
// client's own press at the script-body gate and sends it, naming the drive it saw seated; the host runs it with the
// drone console's reach test, mid-join wait and rate limit (drone_call_intent) once its own eraser's slot holds that
// drive, waiting only while the slot line naming it waits for the drive to bind, and the wipe reaches every peer as
// the host's row. Every press the host's eraser runs, and its resume, are shown by each client's own eraser (its
// sounds and its wiper), the presser's included; a press the host refuses is shown to its presser alone. Nothing to
// replay on a late join: the wipe's row is the drive lane's, and a press's show lasts its 3 s.
