// coop/interactables/dish_sync.h -- the satellite-dish sync lane.
//
// THE ROOT, measured: every dish slew runs a per-peer Blueprint frame loop with per-slew RNG
// in its start delays and speed; the download ARM rolls per-peer RNG polarity when it
// initialises the signal; and calibration has random writers on every peer. So dish poses, an
// armed download's polarity and the calibration all DIVERGE across peers on their own.
//
// So each axis gets ONE author. POSES: a client's dish simulation is PARKED -- its
// dish-moving ticker stopped, with a paired restore on the teardown fanout -- and the host streams
// movers-only rows plus a settle tail, which one applier drives kinematically through an
// interpolation window, so the stream's rate is not visible as stepping, for the stream rows and
// the join seed alike; a client's ping never succeeds on its own machine (desk_ping_sync). ARM:
// the download machine's arm and reset are coop/interactables/download_arm_sync's, whose replay
// settles the mirror here first (SettleForArm). CALIBRATION: the host authors it too, in a lane
// of its own (coop/interactables/dish_calib_sync), polled from this lane's slow tick, with its own join seed.
