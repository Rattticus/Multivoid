// coop/interactables/dish_hashcode_sync.h -- the dishes' hash codes are the host's.
//
// generteHashcode writes a dish's `hashcode`, the nine-line text the SAT console's sv.hash shows and
// sv.request exports onto a disc, from fresh random bytes; the day rollover is its one caller, once per
// dish in one frame. A client never rolls a midnight, so its codes stayed the ones its save carried. So
// the gate's post on the host's generteHashcode marks the dish, the next tick sends every marked dish's
// code, and a client writes them in and refuses a generteHashcode of its own. Rows for a dish a client
// has not resolved wait for it. Late join (principle 8): the transferred save carries the codes as the
// host captured them, a broadcast skips a joiner whose world is not up, and so every code goes to the
// joiner again at its world-ready, which covers a midnight between the capture and that edge. MTA's
// shape: a change goes to joined players only, a joiner gets every element's state
// (reference/mtasa-blue/Server/mods/deathmatch/logic/CStaticFunctionDefinitions.cpp:1033-1034,
// reference/mtasa-blue/Server/mods/deathmatch/logic/CMapManager.cpp:195). Game thread.
