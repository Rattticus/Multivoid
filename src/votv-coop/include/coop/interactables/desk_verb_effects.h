// coop/interactables/desk_verb_effects.h -- what a desk press the host runs for a client makes for that client
// alone: the glossary entry its SAVE adds, the sounds its branches play, and what a decode its start began adds.
//
// The SAVE branch's lib_C::addGloss(name, 0, desk) writes getMainSave(), the save_main of the machine that runs
// it (lib.cpp:3472-3477, :4143), so run on the host for a client's press the entry would land in the host's
// profile. The branches' PlaySound2D clicks are 2D, heard at one level anywhere (analogDScreenTest.cpp:2611,
// :2696), so the host would hear a client's press and the client nothing, its own press refused. While a
// Replay is open the host refuses both, addGloss at the script-body gate and PlaySound2D at a pre hook armed
// only inside it (ue_wrap/core/ufunction_hook), and sends each to the presser, whose machine makes the call for
// itself. The scope is the replay's own rather than the gate's IsBodyActive(actionOptionIndex): the host's own
// press runs the same body and keeps its gloss and its clicks (drive_sync.cpp:108-132). A client's refiner
// decode completes long after its press, in calculate_comp's body: its gloss is forwarded on the gate's scope
// of that body (ForwardGlossesInBody), and its signals_processed point comp_sync sends as a stat. Game thread.
