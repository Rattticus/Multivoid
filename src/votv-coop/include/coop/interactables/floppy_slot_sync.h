// coop/interactables/floppy_slot_sync.h -- a disc-holding device's slot as shared state: the server boxes and the
// laptop. An insert moves the disc into its device's fields and destroys the actor, so a slot on no wire loses discs:
// the other peer's device answers an eject with "No floppy disc in the slot", and a rejoin makes it permanent. So the
// slot is state, the host owns it, and a peer reports the outcome of a slot its own game changed. The laptop's digest
// is which disc it holds; its files between two such changes are its quad's (coop/interactables/laptop_buffer_sync),
// which carries this lane's generation. That is MTA's shape for an entity entering a container: the slot states are the
// server's, ship with the entity, and a client's transfer is a request the server answers
// (reference/mtasa-blue/Server/mods/deathmatch/logic/CGame.cpp, VEHICLE_REQUEST_IN). We diverge
// on one point: the claim carries an outcome rather than asking -- insertFloppy and ejectFloppy
// have already run on the peer that reports them -- and the host's canonical is the answer a
// client applies over its own optimistic copy; two peers' changes crossing inside one answer are
// decided by the later claim (docs/devices.md, Known limits).
