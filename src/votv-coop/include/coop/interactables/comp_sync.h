// coop/interactables/comp_sync.h -- the desk's refiner (the decode pane): the host decodes, every client mirrors.
//
// The decode's step -- the desk's tick reaching calculate_comp -- advances on the dream state, active_comp and
// comp_isDecodeActive alone, and its completion fires world triggers (theEvil_C, the deer, the rozship) and writes
// the running machine's profile, so one machine holds the latch: the host's. A client's start and stop are presses
// the host replays (desk_verb_intent), and every comp_start a client's machine reaches -- the join's restore resumes
// a saved decode -- is refused at the script gate with `succ` false.
//
// The decode's OWNER is the slot whose start latched the host's machine: a replayed start's presser, else the host;
// unchanged across the completion's continue, and the host's once its owner leaves. A client's completion gloss is
// forwarded to it (desk_verb_effects), and its signals_processed point put back on the host and sent. The host
// streams CompState while decoding, on its edges and on a completion, the level-up riding the CompData edge; a
// client applies the host's alone, writing progress and downloading, painting the texts the mirror's own calls
// leave wrong and driving the cues off the wire's edges, never the latch. Game thread throughout.
