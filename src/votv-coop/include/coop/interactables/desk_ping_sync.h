// coop/interactables/desk_ping_sync.h -- the ping's verdict on the main desk is the host's. A client's own ping runs
// whole as its presentation and its clock: its start, loop, bars and stage sounds reach everyone through the desk log
// and sound lanes, as a ping does in single player. At its stage 3 its gate refuses the renderer's gatherSignal, with
// the out parameters written false, and so the failure line and sound that follow in that process_coords body; the
// verdict intent carries its view and aim to the host. The host writes them and primes its own machine to stage 2
// complete from the pre of its next process_coords, so that very body rolls the verdict against the sky of that moment
// and runs the native consequences, whose lines, sound, catch and dishes cross on their own lanes. The host keeps back
// that body's stage-change cue, and hands the pinger the catch's authorship and the find on its profile. The cheat
// menu's isntaCatchSignal, the same verdict outside the machine, crosses as its own op, and the host runs its own
// where its game lets a player cheat. Game thread, every function.
