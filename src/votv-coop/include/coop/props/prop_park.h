// coop/props/prop_park.h -- a prop a receiver parks: while another peer's hand or the host's drive moves it,
// its body stops simulating, and the receiver gives it back simulating. A Character welded onto a prop -- the
// Kerfus's navigation pawn is the one measured -- moves only while the prop's body does not simulate: its
// movement skips a tick whose capsule simulates, and a welded capsule answers with its weld parent's state. So a
// park wakes it. The Kerfus's pawn then falls, its capsule blocking nothing, and each step re-welds it lower: the
// prop's centre of mass falls with it, at 44 m/s on a copy, and the spin a throw gives at release swings the prop
// about that far point -- a thrown copy flew 1.26 km. A park therefore holds still the movement of each Character
// it wakes (rider_hold.h), and the give-back lets it go once the body simulates. MTA gives an attached ped no
// movement of its own; what carries it places it
// (reference/mtasa-blue/Client/mods/deathmatch/logic/CClientPed.cpp:3441-3442,
// reference/mtasa-blue/Client/mods/deathmatch/logic/CClientEntity.cpp:1183-1195). Game thread, every function.
