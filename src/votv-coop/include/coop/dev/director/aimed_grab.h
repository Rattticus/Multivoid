// coop/dev/director/aimed_grab.h -- the director's grab of a loose prop, as a player's use key takes it. The camera
// turns through a fan round the prop until the player's own interaction trace strikes it (the trace runs on the
// player's tick, so each pose is held a few ticks), then the use key's grab chain runs in its order -- the prop's
// playerGrabbed_pre, the player's useAction, the prop's playerGrabbed -- and the grab is verified on the player's
// grabbing actor. DEV-ONLY, like the rest of the director; game thread.
