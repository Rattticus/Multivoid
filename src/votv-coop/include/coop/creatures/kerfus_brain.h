// coop/creatures/kerfus_brain.h -- the plain kerfur (the Kerfus, p_kerfus_C) thinks on the host alone.
//
// The Kerfus is a prop with a brain: its tick drains or charges its energy and drives its wheel toward the next
// point of an invisible nav pawn, two timers re-path it and unstick it, and its server job walks to a broken
// server box and fixes it. Every peer loaded the same Kerfus from the save, so every peer ran that brain on its
// own copy: each followed its own player, drained its own energy and fixed servers only for itself. MTA runs a
// ped's AI on one syncer and shows the rest the syncer's state
// (reference/mtasa-blue/Server/mods/deathmatch/logic/CPedSync.cpp:106-139); here the host is the one syncer. On
// a client this lane refuses the brain's own bodies at the script-body gate, on p_kerfus_C and every colour
// variant, which inherits them or calls them as its parent's: the tick, the two timer events, the movement and
// server-job functions, the haunting, the laptop's jump and the cord events that set `charging`. The pose comes
// from the host's drive stream, the state from kerfus_state, a client's presses become kerfus_intent's requests,
// and a last guard refuses a server box's fix() from a Kerfus's body that began before its watch went live. The
// nav pawn welded on the body is stilled on a client where the host's brain keeps it, its movement held
// (coop/props/rider_hold.h). Engine access through ue_wrap; game thread.
