// coop/world/coord_tower_rows.h -- the coordinate towers' state as rows (CoordTowerState, op 0). The host reads
// its towers each tick and sends every tower's row whenever one or an acknowledgement changed, and all of them to a
// joiner at its world-ready. A client never rolls a tower (coop/world/coord_tower_ops refuses it), so the rows are
// its towers' only author: it applies each change as the tower's own graph makes it, the painters for the state,
// the repair through solvePuzzle, the lever through moveLever, the panel through its own retract once its montage
// is idle, with its own untaken fuse claims on top. The element-data shape: a client applies the server's value
// and hands its handlers the old one with the new (reference/mtasa-blue/Client/mods/deathmatch/logic/
// CClientEntity.cpp:470-499). Game thread throughout.
