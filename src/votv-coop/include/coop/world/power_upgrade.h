// coop/world/power_upgrade.h -- the host's record that a client spent an upgrade at a generator, and the refund of
// an install the host refused after the item was spent. Principle-7 gameplay layer, beside coop/world/power_grid,
// whose install op takes the record. A client's insert (generator playerUsedOn @3343) destroys the held upgrade and
// raises its own copy's level before the op reaches the host, so two players installing at a generator's last free
// place leave the second one's upgrade spent and its op refused. The host hears every client destroy it applies
// (coop/props/remote_prop): an upgrade destroyed within reach of a generator's upgrade slot is a spend, recorded
// against its sender and that generator. An install is taken only against a spend, and a refused one is refunded
// only against one, so a refund never exceeds an item paid.
