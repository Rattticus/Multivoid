// coop/world/coord_tower_ops.h -- what a player does at a coordinate tower, and the one roll a tower makes. A
// client never rolls a tower: its Scramble Radar Dish and its lever's judgement are refused at the script gate on
// every route (the fuckuper's timer, an explosion, its own load), so the host's world is the towers' author and
// its rows (coop/world/coord_tower_rows) the client's. A client's press of a puzzle button, the lever or the
// panel's retract is refused there too and sent to the host, which runs the tower's own use with the look-at
// answered. A pull or an insert moves a fuse into or out of the player's own hand, so the client's own game makes
// it and claims the slot; the host takes the claim when its own copy allows the move, and refuses it otherwise:
// a refused pull's fuse is reaped from the puller's hand (coop/interactables/floppybox_sync's pop), a refused
// insert's fuse given back where the inserter stands (coop/world/power_upgrade's refund), an insert taken only
// against a fuse the host saw the inserter spend at that tower. The host runs a sender's ops in its order, within
// reach, at a bounded rate. Game thread throughout.
