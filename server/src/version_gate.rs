//! Which game versions may host: the shape check that remains of the version-pair gate (2026-08-29).
//!
//! The register endpoint used to swallow ANY self-reported version pair -- a
//! field host was seen advertising "b148" when no such build exists, and the
//! lobby list dutifully rendered it (every real client sees an unjoinable
//! impossible-version row: pure pollution, and it reads as "a newer build
//! exists"). The pair is self-reported and host attestation is a separate arc
//! (docs/security/README.md -- peer certificates), so this gate is now deliberately
//! minimal: it refuses SHAPE-invalid game strings and NOTHING ELSE.
//!
//! THE BUILD-NUMBER CEILING IS RETIRED (2026-08-31). `COOP_MAX_BUILD` and
//! `COOP_ALLOWED_BUILDS` are no longer read; see version_gate for why. Any
//! deployment still carrying them in /etc/coop-master.env can leave them there --
//! they are simply ignored, so retiring this needs no coordinated redeploy, which
//! is itself the point.
//! proto==0 (legacy pre-v122 hosts) always passed and still does.

/// (`COOP_MAX_BUILD`) and the exact-set allowlist (`COOP_ALLOWED_BUILDS`) are RETIRED. A
/// ceiling that refuses hosting to a build the master has not been told about stops testers
/// on fresh builds from playing at all, which costs more than the listing it was cleaning up.
///
/// They were added for A58 -- a field host advertised a build that did not exist and the
/// browser listed it, which reads as "a newer version is out". The trade turned out bad in
/// both directions:
///
///   * COST: `kProtocolVersion` moves on EVERY wire change by standing rule, so anyone
///     running a build newer than the deployed env value was refused hosting outright
///     ("build bN does not exist"). That is us denying our own testers, and it made every
///     proto bump require a coordinated master redeploy BEFORE anybody could host.
///   * BENEFIT: A58's own recorded residual already says number-based gating "cannot
///     attribute, only bound" -- a spoofer simply claims a REAL number instead.
///
/// And the pollution it defended against is now handled honestly by the client, which it
/// was not when this was written: an unknown build renders with the red mismatch mark, the
/// details panel names which side must update, and `JoinLobby` refuses on byte-equality
/// with a popup before any connection is made. A row that cannot be joined says so.
///
/// What STAYS is `game_shape_ok`, because that is a PARSING concern (keep arbitrary
/// strings out of a field every browser renders), not a version-policy one.
